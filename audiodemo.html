<h1>Basic Tests: JS Audio</h1>
<p> Note: It is crucial that, if you're developing on Firefox, you go to about:config and set <code>privacy.file_unique_origin</code> to false. If you don't, Firefox will not allow javascript to access image and sound files loaded from the disk. This is not required when the html is loaded from a web server, only when you are loading it from your hard drive.</p>
<p> Furthermore, if you are using Safari, Javascript will not be allowed to play any sounds until one is played during a user interaction event. </p>
